DKW has been the key enabler for USDA in implementing required enhancements to FSIS through waterfall, agile, and hybrid software development methodologies, and we have transitioned 11 USDA legacy systems in the process."},

The GTG-F assists program managers, portfolio managers, engineers, and others in answering two questions critical to any IT or National Security Systems (NSS): (1) Where does the IT or NSS fit, as both a provider and consumer, into the GIG with regard to End-to-End technical performance, access to data and services, and interoperability?; and (2) What must an IT system or NSS do to ensure technical interoperability with the GIG? Several of the GIG Technical Guidance business processes have joined together as a single Web destination that has provided several advantages to our clients, such as ease of use, reduced hosting costs, and increasing data availability to the DoD community. DKW architects, designs, develops, implements, and provides maintenance for the GTG Federated Tools Suite. It is the authoritative source for ISP assessment data, GTPs with implementation guidance, and compliance. The GTG Federated Tools Suite program is a key enabler of the ongoing DISA-led IT enterprise transformation.","DKW modernized the Navy Fleet’s Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Network Operations Center (NOC), which was formerly an antiquated network with an overly complex footprint that was difficult to manage. DKW analyzed the system architecture, the CONOPS, and the security environment to identify which areas needed to be improved and which vulnerabilities needed to be addressed. DKW discovered that the hardware and software were in some cases at end-of-life, a situation which the Navy deemed an unacceptable level of risk."]},
